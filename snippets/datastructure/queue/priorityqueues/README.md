### Description

Implement a Priority Queue. A priority queue is a collection in which items can be added at any time, but the only item that can be removed is the one with the highest priority.

### Example:

```
Input: Push ("value1", 5), Push ("value2", 10), Push ("value3", 3), Pop 
Output: [("value1", 5), ("value3", 3)]
```
