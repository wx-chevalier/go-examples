### Description

Given an input string and a dictionary of words, segment the input string into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words if possible. 

For example, if the input string is "applepie" and dictionary contains a standard set of English words, then we would return the string "apple pie" as output.

### Example 1:

```
Input: string = "applepie", dictionary = "apple", "pie"
Output: "apple pie"
```
