### Description

Implement a Stack using a linked list. A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

### Example:

```
Input: Push "value1", Push "value2", Push "value3", Pop 
Output: ["value2", "value1"]
```
