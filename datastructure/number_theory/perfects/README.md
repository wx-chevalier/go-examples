### Description

A number is a perfect number if is equal to sum of its proper divisors, that is, sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Write a function to check if a given number is perfect or not.

### Example 1:

```
Input: number = 15
Output: false

Divisors of 15 are 1, 3 and 5. 
Sum of divisors is 9 which is not equal to 15.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: number = 6
Output: true

Divisors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3. 
Sum of divisors is 6.
```
